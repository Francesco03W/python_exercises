# Python Exercises:
 ### direct_measure_tool.py:
   Math functions to double check results obtained by other means.  
   No truncation or significant digits approximation, all values are displayed fully as computed (float).  
   Measurement units are NOT taken account of.  
   Between units and decimals use dot -> .  

   Functions:  
   Returns standard uncertainty and esteem of multiple measurements (A type - measurement device accuracy correction not included,see C type)  
   Returns standard uncertainty and esteem of any size with nominal value and tolerance from datasheet, i.e resistance (B type)  
   Returns standard uncertainty/standard deviation (esteem=0) of uniform distribution probability density function, i.e device accuracy correction (C type)
